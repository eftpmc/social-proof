## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) - React framework

### What I learned

During this challenge, I learned and worked with grids and flexboxes. I worked with these displays and learned how to make websites optimized for phones as well. Once the size of the screen reaches a certain width, it switches all the text and elements on the page making it optimal for phone users. I also learned how to make offsets and how to create visual interest on a page.
